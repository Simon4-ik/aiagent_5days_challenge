5 Days AI Agent Challenge – Completed Project

Welcome to my project submission for the 5 Days AI Agent Challenge on Kaggle.
This repository contains all notebooks, workflows, and documentation created during the challenge. The goal of the challenge was to learn, design, and deploy functional AI Agents capable of executing tasks autonomously using modern LLM tools.

🚀 Overview

The 5-day AI Agent Challenge guided participants through building practical AI agents step-by-step.
During these 5 days, I implemented multiple agents, explored agent architecture patterns, and successfully completed all required tasks.

This repository includes:

Fully implemented agent notebooks for each day

Custom improvements I added beyond the challenge

Final working multi-agent system

Notes, experiments, and insights gathered during the challenge

📅 Daily Breakdown
📘 Day 1 – Understanding AI Agents

Learned the fundamentals of agent design

Implemented a basic prompting agent

Explored ReAct, tool usage, and structured reasoning

⚙️ Day 2 – Single-Tool Agent

Built an agent that interacts with one main tool

Integrated decision-making logic

Added basic planning and task execution

🛠️ Day 3 – Multi-Tool Agent

Created an agent capable of using multiple tools

Designed tool-selection logic for automatic reasoning

Improved error handling and fallbacks

🤖 Day 4 – Multi-Agent System

Built a system of specialized agents communicating with each other

Developed:

Planner Agent

Research Agent

Writer Agent

Implemented role-based communication and delegation

🏁 Day 5 – Final AI Agent Project

Completed a full autonomous agent with:

Dynamic task planning

Tool integration

Intermediate reasoning steps

Automated output generation

Tested on real tasks and validated performance

🧠 What I Learned

How LLM-based agents work internally (planning, reasoning, tool calling)

When to use single-agent vs. multi-agent systems

Designing prompts for tools and planning

Building lightweight AI workflow pipelines

Improving autonomy in tasks using structured reasoning (ReAct / Tree-of-Thought)
